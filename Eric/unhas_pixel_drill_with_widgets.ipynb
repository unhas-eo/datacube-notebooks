    "This notebook demonstrates the use of interactive widgets in a Jupyter notebook. We will load up a few time slices of Sentinel-2 data over the Lake Tempe region, Indonesia, and display a widget allowing the user to interactively select a pixel of interest over the selected area. The time series of remote sensing values for that pixel is then plotted, allowing the user to select a given time index to use for the final display of the Sentinel-2 image acquired at that specific date.\n",

For the purpose of this demonstration, we will not carry out the typical data clean-up process to mask pixels affected by data quality issues (saturation, clouds, etc.) &ndash; thus, we do not include the `SCL / mask / qa` band here which would otherwise be needed for this QA filtering process.\n",

So to avoid unnecessary (and time consuming) re-projection of the data, we will here load up the Sentinel-2 dataset in its native projection.
